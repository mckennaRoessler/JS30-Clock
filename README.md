# JS30-Clock

This is the first project I completed to the JavaScript 30 challenge. I followed along with the tutorial while I completed the project, but did the minute and hour hands myself after observing how to create the variables for the second hand. This project taught me how to use the transform-origin attribute of CSS to begin a rotation at the end of a div rather than the center.

Most importantly, the JavaScript I learned from this project consisted of a better understanding of Date, how to transform div styles within JavaScript, the use of now.getSeconds/minutes/hours to get the current time, and reminded me of the use of query selectors to connect a JavaScript variable with an HTML class.
